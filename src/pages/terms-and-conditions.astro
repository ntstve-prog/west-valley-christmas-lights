                <h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>
                <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> January 1, 2025</p>

                <h2>1. Agreement to Terms</h2>
                <p>By engaging West Valley Christmas Lights ("Company," "we," "us," or "our") for Christmas light installation services, you ("Customer," "you," or "your") agree to be bound by these Terms and Conditions. If you do not agree to these terms, please do not use our services.</p>

                <h2>2. Services</h2>
                <p>West Valley Christmas Lights provides professional Christmas light installation services for residential and commercial properties throughout the West Valley area including Surprise, Peoria, El Mirage, and surrounding communities. Our services include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Christmas light installation</li>
                    <li>Light removal services (20% of installation fee)</li>
                    <li>Maintenance and repair during the holiday season</li>
                    <li>Consultation and estimates</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>3. Pricing and Payment</h2>
                <p>All prices are quoted based on property size, number of lights, and complexity of installation. Payment is due upon completion of services unless other arrangements have been made in writing. We accept cash, credit cards, and electronic payments.</p>

                <h2>4. Lights Ownership</h2>
                <p>We install lights that you already own, or we can purchase lights on your behalf and provide you with the receipt. You pay only for the installation service with no upcharge on lights. All lights installed become or remain your property. Unlike many Christmas light installation companies, we do not lease lights - you own them outright with no future obligations.</p>

                <h2>5. Removal Services</h2>
                <p>Light removal after the holiday season is available for 20% of your original installation fee. Removal typically occurs in early January. Since you own the lights, you are responsible for storage after removal, or we can assist with storage arrangements.</p>

                <h2>6. Installation Process</h2>
                <p>Installation typically takes 2-4 hours depending on property size and design complexity. We are not responsible for pre-existing property damage discovered during installation. Any concerns about your property's condition should be disclosed before service begins.</p>

                <h2>7. Maintenance Services</h2>
                <p>If any lights malfunction during the holiday season, we offer maintenance services to repair or replace damaged lights. Contact us promptly if issues arise so we can ensure your display looks perfect throughout the season.</p>

                <h2>8. Limitation of Liability</h2>
                <p>Our total liability for any claims related to our services shall not exceed the amount paid for the specific service. We are not liable for indirect, incidental, or consequential damages.</p>

                <h2>9. Property Condition</h2>
                <p>Customer represents that their property is in good condition and suitable for light installation. Any pre-existing damage, structural concerns, or accessibility issues should be disclosed before service begins.</p>

                <h2>10. Cancellation Policy</h2>
                <p>Appointments may be cancelled or rescheduled with at least 24 hours notice. Same-day cancellations may be subject to a service fee.</p>

                <h2>11. Weather and Scheduling</h2>
                <p>Installation may be rescheduled due to inclement weather or unsafe working conditions. We will work with you to find an alternative date as soon as conditions permit.</p>

                <h2>12. Governing Law</h2>
                <p>These terms are governed by Arizona state law. Any disputes shall be resolved in the courts of Maricopa County, Arizona.</p>

                <h2>13. Changes to Terms</h2>
                <p>We reserve the right to modify these terms at any time. Updated terms will be posted on our website with the revision date.</p>
